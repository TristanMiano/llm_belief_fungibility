belief_fungibility_experiment.py

Experiment to test "belief fungibility" in LLMs by having one Gemini model argue
for a proposition (on both the “true” and “false” side) and measuring belief
shifts in a second Gemini model as the target. Uses Google GenAI Python SDK
(google-genai) generate_content API, with retry logic on rate limits.
